2. Classification 

   The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

   1). Input variables
   
      # bank client data:
      1 - age (numeric)
      2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
      3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
      4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
      5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
      6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
      7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
      
      # related with the last contact of the current campaign:
      8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') 
      9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
      10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
      11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
      
      # other attributes:
      12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
      13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
      14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
      15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
      
      # social and economic context attributes
      16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
      17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
      18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
      19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
      20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)
      
   2). Output variables (desired target):

      21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')

5. Incorporating categorical variables into a linear regression model

    1). dummy coding
    Which assigns values "1" and "0" to reflect the presence and absence, respectively, of a treatment level.
    Each dummy variable will be compared to the reference level, which will be coded as "0" for all dummy variables

    Example
                Treatment       Dummy1          Dummy2
                A               1               0
                B               0               1
                C               0               0


    2). effect coding
